# Projet restaurant

#### In this project we were asked to build a website for a restaurant. 

Since we were a team of five we divided the work so each one of us had to do one page.

- The Index page was made by **Ellen**
- The Menu page was made by **Aur√©lien**
- The Pictures page was made by **Jean-Louis**
- The Restaurant page was made by **William**
- The Contact page was made by **Asuna**

We agreed on a graphic chart for the website : 

- Index will have a background-img while the rest with a white background which will allow the important stuff on the pages to step-out.
- The menu will have a golden background coz it's shiny and *we like shiny things*.
