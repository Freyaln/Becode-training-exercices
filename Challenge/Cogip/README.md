We are a group of 5 people, we started by identifying the tasks and dividing them up. 
Then we looked at the DOC on MVC and MySQL, as this is our first project in MVC with PHP and MySQL.


### Prerequisites

What is required to get started with your project...

- Build the MVC structure
- Set up a router 
- Set up a common database 
- Follow the recommendations for building the site to the letter


### Our work 

We had to create an intranet page for a company called Cogip 
Implementing access to data for users
Implementing usability for the admin and the moderator 

## Use principle 

The admin can after connection directly modify the data in the database,
i.e. : 

- add
- modify
- delete 

The moderator can add new data in the database

  1. PHP - *POO with MVC structure*
