#### Funny story:

When I was a kid, I went to France for vacation on Christmas holiday. I did go there every year or so, but in always in summer. 
This time everything was covered in snow, it was really magical to see this enormous, endless white coat on the ground. With my sister we decided to make an *igloo*, we did make it, but once we where inside it collapsed on us. Where we afraid and chocked ? **Yes**, but it was really a fun experience.

##### Making an igloo as a child and being burried inside it.
